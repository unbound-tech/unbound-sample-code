# Cryptographic Operations

Sample code showing the basic building blocks to implement cryptosystems. The samples use PKCS#11 and/or the Java provider.

1. Derive - derive secondary key
2. Encrypt - encryption and decryption of data
3. Sign - data signing and signature verification
4. Wrap - save key material while securing it by another key
