# Unbound CASP Signature Generation for Bitcoin Proof of Ownership

This sample app shows how to use Unbound CASP for generating a signature that can be used for [Bitcoin Proof of Ownership](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Proof_of_Ownership).

The input is a [JSON file](https://github.com/unbound-tech/unbound-sample-code/blob/main/blockchain/bitcoin/proof-of-ownership/javascript/casp-sign-op-complete.json) with CASP sign operatation data received from CASP with the [getSignOperation](https://www.unboundtech.com/docs/CASP/API/casp-byow.html#get-sign-operation) API.

If you want to test it using your own CASP vault you can use the [generate script](https://github.com/unbound-tech/unbound-sample-code/blob/main/blockchain/bitcoin/proof-of-ownership/javascript/generate.js)
